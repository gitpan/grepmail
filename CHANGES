New in version 4.48:
- Grepmail now converts Gnus emails into mbox emails before printing them.
  (Thanks to Johan Vromans <JVromans@squirrel.nl> for supplying a patch and
  explaining the need for it.

New in version 4.47:
- Fixed a couple bugs in -M processing
- -M is now 19% faster. (It's now only about 9% slower than without -M.)

New in version 4.46:
- Fixed a bug in -u message id processing. (Thanks go to an anonymous bug
  reporter on SourceForge.)
- Added more workarounds to prevent warnings resulting from a bug in Perl 5.6
  (Thanks to Joey Hess <joey@kitenet.net>)
- Added -Z flag to tell grepmail not to use Mail::Folder::FastReader even if
  it is installed.
- Fixed a bug introduced in version 4.44 where -m would not work unless used
  with -n. (Thanks to Imre Simon <is@ime.usp.br> for catching this.)
- --help anywhere on the command line now causes the help to be printed,
  instead of only when used as the first argument.
- Test script now exercises both the Mail::Folder::FastReader and perl mailbox
  implementations as appropriate.
- Restructured code to separate out Perl mailbox implementation as
  Mail::Folder::SlowReader. (This module is embedded in the grepmail script.)

New in version 4.45:
- Added -n and -V to usage message. (Thanks to Wolfgang Rohdewald
  <WRohdewald@dplanet.ch> for catching this.)
- Added workarounds to prevent warnings resulting from a bug in Perl 5.6
- A blank line before the start of an email is not required now. This
  allows broken folders created by Netscape to be read. (Thanks to Jeremy
  Malcolm <terminus@terminus.net.au> for the bug report.)
- Mail::FastReader is 8% faster.

New in version 4.44:
- execution with -M flag now 35% faster
- Added a Mail::Folder::FastReader module which can cause grepmail to
  run 10-40% faster, depending on your system. Since this module is
  experimental, the installation script will allow you to not install
  the module. A C compiler is required.
- "-----Original Message-----" now recognized as beginning an included
  message
- Fixed a bug where errors would not be displayed if compressed data
  was piped to grepmail
- Date::Parse is now only required if -d is used. (Date::Manip is
  still only required if you use complex date specfications.) (Thanks
  to Richard Stallman <rms@gnu.org> for pointing this out.)
- Added -n flag to print line numbers a la grep. (Thanks to Richard
  Stallman <rms@gnu.org> for the suggestion)
- Fixed a bug in debug output where the email subject was actually the
  sender
- Fixed an undefined value in the printing of flag information
- An ASCII file is now determined to be a mailbox if it has a line
  whose prefix is 'From' or 'X-From-Line:', and another line whose
  prefix is 'Received ', 'Date:', 'Subject:', 'X-Status:', or
  'Status:'.
- Error exits now return 1 (Thanks to Wolfgang Rohdewald
  <WRohdewald@dplanet.ch> for the bug report)
- -V flag prints the version (Thanks to Wolfgang Rohdewald
  <WRohdewald@dplanet.ch> for the feature request)
- Restructured code: localized reading of the emails from the file,
  removed two functions

New in version 4.43:
- Fixed a bug in -r counting when used with -h. (Thanks to Andrew
  <andrew@ugh.net.au> for the bug report.)
- Fixed a bug in the handling of included messages. (Thanks to Antoine
  Martin <antonus@libertysurf.fr> for the bug report and suggestion
  for the fix.)

New in version 4.42:
- Added -a flag to use received date instead of sent date for -d matches.
  (Thanks to Michael Liljeblad <liljeblad at users.sourceforge.net> for the
  patch.)
- Included emails are now ignored properly (Thanks to an anonymous submittor 
  for the bug report and part of a patch
  https://sourceforge.net/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=112159&group_id=2207)
- If an email has no date, the -d switch now issues a warning and does not
  treat the email as a match (Thanks to David Blaine <blained at
  users.sourceforge.net> for the bug report.)
- -d "" can be used to find emails without dates
- Mailbox files are now detected as files using
  if ($buffer =~ /^(X-From-Line:|From) /im && $buffer =~ /^Subject: /im)
  rather than
  if ($buffer =~ /^(X-From-Line:|From) /im && $buffer =~ /^Date: /im)
- Improved detection of binary files. (Thanks to Dan Sugalski
  <dan@tuatha.sidhe.org> for the sample code.)
- STDERR and STDOUT now checked separately during "make test"
- Headers can now be in the format "Date:<tab>" in addition to "Date: "
  (Thanks to Benjamin Korvemaker <korvemaker at users.sourceforge.net> for the
  patch and concept.)

New in version 4.41:
- Support for Gnus-style mail files added (Thanks to Werner Bosse
  <Werner.Bosse@alcatel.de> for the patch.)
- Test mail files tweaked to make the test cases work better across all time
  zones. (Thanks to Andreas Kutschera <Andreas.Kutschera@bln.siemens.de> for
  the patch.)
- Added check for unparsable dates in email headers.
- Fixed a Perl warning raised when date parsing fails.
- Added instructions for getting the necessary modules to README.

New in version 4.40:
- Date::Parse and Date::Manip version unified -- Date::Parse is now required,
  and Date::Manip (if present) is used to parse complex dates. (Patch by
  Seth Cohn <sethcohn@users.sourceforge.net>, modified by David Coppit)

New in version 4.31:
- Distro has missing test cases for -u functionality. Doh!

New in version 4.30:
- Updated code to avoid warnings under Perl 5.6 (Thanks to Andreas Kutschera
  <Andreas.Kutschera@bln.siemens.de> for the bug report.)
- Fixed a bug in the test script where bzip2, gzip, and tzip support would not
  be tested even though the programs were available. (Thanks to Andreas
  Kutschera <Andreas.Kutschera@bln.siemens.de> for the patch.)
- Added standard --help flag (Patch by Seth Cohn <seth@users.sourceforge.net>)
- Added -u ("unique") flag, which ensures that no duplicate messages will be
  output. (A BIG thanks to Seth Cohn <seth@users.sourceforge.net>.)

New in version 4.23:
- Updated the test cases to work better in timezones close to +0000 and +2300.
  (email if you have problems with tests 1 and 23. Thanks to Harald Krause
  <harald.krause@a-city.de> for first finding the bug, and Adam Huffman
  <adam.huffman@man.ac.uk> for his help debugging it.)
- Fixed a bug in the "ignore attachments" code

New in version 4.22:
- grepmail now behaves better when tzip, bzip2 or gunzip aren't present on the
  system.
- The code has been restructured to compile more easily with perlcc.

New in version 4.21:
- Fixed a bug that would cause grepmail to runaway when a pipe following it
  was broken. (Thanks to Gerald Pfeifer <pfeifer@dbai.tuwien.ac.at> for the
  bug report)

New in version 4.20:
- grepmail development has been moved to SourceForge, and made public. Visit
  http://grepmail.sourceforge.net/
- Added -s flag, which limits matched emails to a given size
- Restructured the code to be more robust with respect to feature interaction.
  (At a 5-10% slowdown cost.)
- Fixed an uninitialized variable warning caused by emails without subjects in
  debug mode.

New in version 4.11:
- Fixed a bug where an ASCII file would not be recognized as a mailbox when
  the first couple emails did not have a "From:" line. (Thanks to Jeff Flowers
  <jeff.flowers@npl.co.uk>)
- Added standard Perl testing.

New in version 4.1:
- Stripped auto-perl execution code, since it never works on all platforms.
  (Installation instructions modified to require the user to fix the #! line.)
- Minor changes to allow grepmail to run without -w complaints.

New in version 4.0:
- Fixed a bug where shell characters needed to be escaped for compressed
  files. (Bug found by Richard Clamp <richardc@tw2.com>
- Added #!/bin/sh as first line to make the rest compatible with csh/tcsh
  users. (Bug found by Ed Arnold <era@ucar.edu>)

New in version 3.9:
- Took out specialization engine because there wasn't enough support to
  program in that style.
- Offering 2 main versions now -- Date::Manip and Date::Parse
- Added -R option, which causes grepmail to recurse any directories
  encountered. (Thanks to Emil Tiller <etiller@asc.corp.mot.com> for the
  initial code.)
- Fixed a small bug that would cause some attachments not to be identified.

New in version 3.8:
- Added a prototype engine to allow users to specialize grepmail at
  installation time. (See below)
- Fixed buggy mailbox detection algorithm
- Fixed bug in identification of email headers.
- Fixed bug in parsing timezones of emails. (Thanks to Wolfgang Weisselberg
  <weisselberg@element5.de>)
- Fixed bug in handling of date specifications like "2 days ago" and "2 weeks
  ago"
- Added -M switch, which causes grepmail to ignore non-text attachments.
- Added "quiet mode", -q switch, which supresses warnings about directories,
  non-mailbox ASCII files, binary files that can't be decompressed, etc.
- Restructured code a bit. Moved file and STDIN processing out of main. The
  whole email is now read before the match is made to the body, instead of
  trying to match the pattern while reading the body. (This simplifies the
  algorithms and makes -M support a lot easier, at the cost of increasing the
  required memory slightly.) Now uses ungetc to put the test characters used
  during file type detection back on the stream.

New in version 3.7:
- Added -D for debugging output
- Now ignores ASCII files that don't look like mailboxes. Thanks to oak
  <oak@eskimo.com> for pointing this out.
- Uses Date::Parse instead of Date::Manip, which results in faster execution
  time at the expense of less flexibility. (e.g. You can't do "12pm January 5
  1997" any more)

New in version 3.6:
- No more temporary files! This addresses the security issues that a few
  people have sent me email about. The script may use slightly more memory,
  depending on the size of the largest email. (Email is now buffered as it is
  read, and the whole buffer is printed when a match occurs. This is in
  contrast to storing the file pointer and seeking back to the start of the
  email.) The script is substantially faster for large amounts of data piped
  as STDIN. Many thanks go to Joey Hess (<joey@kitenet.net>), who supplied
  insights and contributions toward making this release happen, especially the
  buffering code.  

New in version 3.5:
- grepmail will not try to decompress piped input that is empty.
- Temporary files are now placed in the user's home directory to help avoid
  privacy attacks (or in the directory specified by the TMPDIR environment
  variable, if it exists).
- Fixed a bug that would occasionally leave a tempfile around.

New in version 3.4.1:
- Fixed a bug that added an extra line to the start of output. (Thanks to
  Moritz Barsnick <barsnick@gmx.net> for helping to find this.)

New in version 3.4:
- Added tzip support. (thanks to Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>)
- Reordered flags to better match grep.
- Changed command line syntax again. (Last time, I hope.)

New in version 3.3:
- Added bzip2 support. (thanks to Josh Plautz <plautz@milner.com>).
- Improved error checking on piped binary input.
- Added debugging code.

New in version 3.2:
- Added TMPFILE environment variable support, and a signal handler. (thanks
  to Ulli Horlacher (<framstag@moep.bb.bawue.de>).
- Fixed a bug where the last paragraph of the last email in a mailbox would
  not be printed on Linux. (How's that for obscure? Thanks to Eli Criffield
  <rexracer@mammoth.org> for discovering it.)

New in version 3.1:
- Modified the decompression to be more compatible with older versions of gzip.
- Improved error checking so that "grepmail -h" prints a usage message.
- Added -m flag, which causes an "X-Mailfolder" line to be added to the
  header, thereby showing which folder contained the message. (by Ulli
  Horlacher <framstag@moep.bb.bawue.de>).
- Improved error checking on flags.
- Changed "zcat" to "gunzip -c" to help with backwards compatibility with older
  versions of gzip (thanks to Eugene Kim <eekim@eekim.com>).

New in version 3.0:
- -h and -b can be used together.
- Rewrote the ProcessMailFile to run 2 to 3 times faster, and use less memory.
- Correctly diagnoses directories as such (by Gerald Pfeifer
  <pfeifer@dbai.tuwien.ac.at>).

New in version 2.1:
- Added -l,-r, and -e, as suggested by Reinhard Max <max@suse.de>.
- Now uses about 1/3 the memory, and is a little faster.

New in version 2.0.1:
- Added POD documentation at the end of the script (thanks, Jeffrey
  Haemer <jsh@boulder.qms.com>).
- -h for headers only -b for body only

New in version 1.9:
- "Ignore empty files" by Gerald Pfeifer <pfeifer@dbai.tuwien.ac.at>.
- Emails without dates are now automatically output no matter what the
  date specification is. (Better safe than sorry!)

New in version 1.7:
- Sped up by Andrew Johnson. It no longer looks for dates unless the email
  matches the search string.

New in version 1.6:
- Removed use of Compress::Zlib because it was 30% slower, complicated the
  code, and because any user with gzip'd mail has zcat...

New in version 1.5:
- Andrew Johnson <ajohnson@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca> fixed a couple of bugs.

New in version 1.4:
- Incorporated conditional loading of the date module (submitted by Andrew
  Johnson <ajohnson@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca> Many thanks!).
- compress::Zlib used instead of shelling out to gunzip (submitted by Andrew
  Johnson <ajohnson@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca> Many thanks!).
- Some bug fixes (submitted by Andrew Johnson <ajohnson@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca>
  Many thanks!).
- Also restructured the code a bit.

New in version 1.3:
- Made it pipeable so you can do: grepmail <pattern> file | grepmail <pattern>

New in version 1.2:
- Restructured the code a bit.

New in version 1.1:
- Support for dates.

New in version 1.0:
- Initial version, with -v -i, and gzip support
