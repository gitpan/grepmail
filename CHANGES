New in version 4.22:
- grepmail now behaves better when tzip, bzip2 or gunzip aren't present on the
  system.
- The code has been restructured to compile more easily with perlcc.

New in version 4.21:
- Fixed a bug that would cause grepmail to runaway when a pipe following it
  was broken. (Thanks to Gerald Pfeifer <pfeifer@dbai.tuwien.ac.at> for the
  bug report)

New in version 4.20:
- grepmail development has been moved to SourceForge, and made public. Visit
  http://grepmail.sourceforge.net/
- Added -s flag, which limits matched emails to a given size
- Restructured the code to be more robust with respect to feature interaction.
  (At a 5-10% slowdown cost.)
- Fixed an uninitialized variable warning caused by emails without subjects in
  debug mode.

New in version 4.11:
- Fixed a bug where an ASCII file would not be recognized as a mailbox when
  the first couple emails did not have a "From:" line. (Thanks to Jeff Flowers
  <jeff.flowers@npl.co.uk>)
- Added standard Perl testing.

New in version 4.1:
- Stripped auto-perl execution code, since it never works on all platforms.
  (Installation instructions modified to require the user to fix the #! line.)
- Minor changes to allow grepmail to run without -w complaints.

New in version 4.0:
- Fixed a bug where shell characters needed to be escaped for compressed
  files. (Bug found by Richard Clamp <richardc@tw2.com>
- Added #!/bin/sh as first line to make the rest compatible with csh/tcsh
  users. (Bug found by Ed Arnold <era@ucar.edu>)

New in version 3.9:
- Took out specialization engine because there wasn't enough support to
  program in that style.
- Offering 2 main versions now -- Date::Manip and Date::Parse
- Added -R option, which causes grepmail to recurse any directories
  encountered. (Thanks to Emil Tiller <etiller@asc.corp.mot.com> for the
  initial code.)
- Fixed a small bug that would cause some attachments not to be identified.

New in version 3.8:
- Added a prototype engine to allow users to specialize grepmail at
  installation time. (See below)
- Fixed buggy mailbox detection algorithm
- Fixed bug in identification of email headers.
- Fixed bug in parsing timezones of emails. (Thanks to Wolfgang Weisselberg
  <weisselberg@element5.de>)
- Fixed bug in handling of date specifications like "2 days ago" and "2 weeks
  ago"
- Added -M switch, which causes grepmail to ignore non-text attachments.
- Added "quiet mode", -q switch, which supresses warnings about directories,
  non-mailbox ASCII files, binary files that can't be decompressed, etc.
- Restructured code a bit. Moved file and STDIN processing out of main. The
  whole email is now read before the match is made to the body, instead of
  trying to match the pattern while reading the body. (This simplifies the
  algorithms and makes -M support a lot easier, at the cost of increasing the
  required memory slightly.) Now uses ungetc to put the test characters used
  during file type detection back on the stream.

New in version 3.7:
- Added -D for debugging output
- Now ignores ASCII files that don't look like mailboxes. Thanks to oak
  <oak@eskimo.com> for pointing this out.
- Uses Date::Parse instead of Date::Manip, which results in faster execution
  time at the expense of less flexibility. (e.g. You can't do "12pm January 5
  1997" any more)

New in version 3.6:
- No more temporary files! This addresses the security issues that a few
  people have sent me email about. The script may use slightly more memory,
  depending on the size of the largest email. (Email is now buffered as it is
  read, and the whole buffer is printed when a match occurs. This is in
  contrast to storing the file pointer and seeking back to the start of the
  email.) The script is substantially faster for large amounts of data piped
  as STDIN. Many thanks go to Joey Hess (<joey@kitenet.net>), who supplied
  insights and contributions toward making this release happen, especially the
  buffering code.  

New in version 3.5:
- grepmail will not try to decompress piped input that is empty.
- Temporary files are now placed in the user's home directory to help avoid
  privacy attacks (or in the directory specified by the TMPDIR environment
  variable, if it exists).
- Fixed a bug that would occasionally leave a tempfile around.

New in version 3.4.1:
- Fixed a bug that added an extra line to the start of output. (Thanks to
  Moritz Barsnick <barsnick@gmx.net> for helping to find this.)

New in version 3.4:
- Added tzip support. (thanks to Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>)
- Reordered flags to better match grep.
- Changed command line syntax again. (Last time, I hope.)

New in version 3.3:
- Added bzip2 support. (thanks to Josh Plautz <plautz@milner.com>).
- Improved error checking on piped binary input.
- Added debugging code.

New in version 3.2:
- Added TMPFILE environment variable support, and a signal handler. (thanks
  to Ulli Horlacher (<framstag@moep.bb.bawue.de>).
- Fixed a bug where the last paragraph of the last email in a mailbox would
  not be printed on Linux. (How's that for obscure? Thanks to Eli Criffield
  <rexracer@mammoth.org> for discovering it.)

New in version 3.1:
- Modified the decompression to be more compatible with older versions of gzip.
- Improved error checking so that "grepmail -h" prints a usage message.
- Added -m flag, which causes an "X-Mailfolder" line to be added to the
  header, thereby showing which folder contained the message. (by Ulli
  Horlacher <framstag@moep.bb.bawue.de>).
- Improved error checking on flags.
- Changed "zcat" to "gunzip -c" to help with backwards compatibility with older
  versions of gzip (thanks to Eugene Kim <eekim@eekim.com>).

New in version 3.0:
- -h and -b can be used together.
- Rewrote the ProcessMailFile to run 2 to 3 times faster, and use less memory.
- Correctly diagnoses directories as such (by Gerald Pfeifer
  <pfeifer@dbai.tuwien.ac.at>).

New in version 2.1:
- Added -l,-r, and -e, as suggested by Reinhard Max <max@suse.de>.
- Now uses about 1/3 the memory, and is a little faster.

New in version 2.0.1:
- Added POD documentation at the end of the script (thanks, Jeffrey
  Haemer <jsh@boulder.qms.com>).
- -h for headers only -b for body only

New in version 1.9:
- "Ignore empty files" by Gerald Pfeifer <pfeifer@dbai.tuwien.ac.at>.
- Emails without dates are now automatically output no matter what the
  date specification is. (Better safe than sorry!)

New in version 1.7:
- Sped up by Andrew Johnson. It no longer looks for dates unless the email
  matches the search string.

New in version 1.6:
- Removed use of Compress::Zlib because it was 30% slower, complicated the
  code, and because any user with gzip'd mail has zcat...

New in version 1.5:
- Andrew Johnson <ajohnson@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca> fixed a couple of bugs.

New in version 1.4:
- Incorporated conditional loading of the date module (submitted by Andrew
  Johnson <ajohnson@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca> Many thanks!).
- compress::Zlib used instead of shelling out to gunzip (submitted by Andrew
  Johnson <ajohnson@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca> Many thanks!).
- Some bug fixes (submitted by Andrew Johnson <ajohnson@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca>
  Many thanks!).
- Also restructured the code a bit.

New in version 1.3:
- Made it pipeable so you can do: grepmail <pattern> file | grepmail <pattern>

New in version 1.2:
- Restructured the code a bit.

New in version 1.1:
- Support for dates.

New in version 1.0:
- Initial version, with -v -i, and gzip support
