grepmail - search mailboxes for a particular email

Grepmail searches a normal, gzip'd, bzip'd, or tzip'd mailbox for a given
regular expression, and returns those emails that match it. Piped input is
allowed, and date and size restrictions are supported.

New in version 4.41:
- Support for Gnus-style mail files added 
- Test mail files tweaked to make the test cases work better across all time
  zones. 
- Added check for unparsable dates in email headers.
- Fixed a Perl warning raised when date parsing fails.
- Added instructions for getting the necessary modules to README.

New in version 4.40:
- Date::Parse and Date::Manip version unified -- Date::Parse is now required,
  and Date::Manip (if present) is used to parse complex dates

See the file CHANGES for a complete change history and credits.


MODULE DEPENDENCIES

grepmail requires the Date::Parse module. If the user wants to use more
complex date specifications with the -d flag, then Date::Manip should be
installed as well.

The Date::Parse module is part of the TimeDate distribution, which can be
downloaded from:

  http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/GBARR/

Date::Manip is at:

  http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/SBECK/

Alternatively, installation can be done automatically using the CPAN module:

  perl -MCPAN -e 'install Date::Parse'
  perl -MCPAN -e 'install Date::Manip'


INSTALLATION

On Non-Windows systems:
  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make
  % make test
  % make install

If make test fails, please run "perl t/functionality.t" and see which test(s)
are failing. Please email the output of running the particular test with the
-D flag to the address below.
