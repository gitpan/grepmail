grepmail version 3.4

Grepmail searches a normal or gzip'ed mailbox for a given regular expression,
and returns those emails that match it. Piped input is allowed, and date
restrictions are supported.

New in version 3.4: Added tzip support. Reordered flags to better match grep.

New in version 3.3: Added bzip2 support. Improved error checking on piped
binary input. Added debugging code.

Please send me any modifications you make. (for the better, that is. :) I have
a suite of tests that I can give you if you ask. Keep in mind that I'm likely
to turn down obscure features to avoid including everything but the kitchen
sink.
