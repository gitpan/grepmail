grepmail - search mailboxes for a particular email

Grepmail searches a normal, gzip'd, bzip'd, or tzip'd mailbox for a given
regular expression, and returns those emails that match it. Piped input is
allowed, and date and size restrictions are supported.

New in version 4.46:
- Fixed a bug in -u message id processing. (Thanks go to an anonymous bug
  reporter on SourceForge.)
- Added more workarounds to prevent warnings resulting from a bug in Perl 5.6
  (Thanks to Joey Hess <joey@kitenet.net>)
- Added -Z flag to tell grepmail not to use Mail::Folder::FastReader even if
  it is installed.
- Fixed a bug introduced in version 4.44 where -m would not work unless used
  with -n. (Thanks to Imre Simon <is@ime.usp.br> for catching this.)
- --help anywhere on the command line now causes the help to be printed,
  instead of only when used as the first argument.
- Test script now exercises both the Mail::Folder::FastReader and perl mailbox
  implementations as appropriate.
- Restructured code to separate out Perl mailbox implementation as
  Mail::Folder::SlowReader. (This module is embedded in the grepmail script.)

New in version 4.45:
- Added -n and -V to usage message.
- Added workarounds to prevent warnings resulting from a bug in Perl 5.6
- A blank line before the start of an email is not required now. This
  allows broken folders created by Netscape to be read.

MODULE DEPENDENCIES

grepmail, by itself, can search mailboxes based on regular expression
patterns. However, if you want to search based on date, the
Date::Parse module is required. If you want to use more complex date
specifications, then Date::Manip should be installed as well.

Starting with version 4.44, an addtional module is distributed with
grepmail, called Mail::Folder::FastReader. It implements the email
reading capability in C for 10-20% faster execution, depending on your
system. This module is compiled and installed during the installation
of grepmail. (See below)

The Date::Parse module is part of the TimeDate distribution, which can be
downloaded from:

  http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/GBARR/

Date::Manip is at:

  http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/SBECK/

Alternatively, installation can be done automatically using the CPAN module:

  perl -MCPAN -e 'install Date::Parse'
  perl -MCPAN -e 'install Date::Manip'


INSTALLATION

=> On Non-Windows systems:

  % perl Makefile.PL
  [Choose whether or not to use Mail::Folder::FastReader.]
  % make
  % make test
  % make install

If make test fails, please run

  make testfunc

and see which test(s) are failing. Please email the output of running
the particular test with the -D flag (e.g.:

  blib/script/grepmail library -D -d "before July 9 1998" t/mailarc-1.txt

to the address below.

=> On Windows systems:

- Just copy "grepmail" to a place in your path
