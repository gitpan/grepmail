grepmail version 3.0

Grepmail searches a normal or gzip'ed mailbox for a given regular expression,
and returns those emails that match it. Piped input is allowed, and date
restrictions are supported.

New in this version: This is a major rewrite of the core code. It now uses
file pointers to read the emails paragraph by paragraph, instead of slurping
the whole email into a variable. The result is 2 to 3 time faster processing,
and memory usage that is proportional to the largest paragraph in the mailbox.
(Typically this is a uuencoded attachment. If enough people complain about the
memory usage, I'll make a flag to ignore attachments.)The semantics of -b and
-h have changed so that using both of the flags is possible, thereby
specifying that the match must occur in both the header and body. Also fixed a
couple of annoyances.
