grepmail - search mailboxes for a particular email

Grepmail searches a normal, gzip'd, bzip'd, or tzip'd mailbox for a given
regular expression, and returns those emails that match it. Piped input is
allowed, and date and size restrictions are supported.

New in version 4.50:
- Added X-Draft-From to support newer versions of Gnus 

NOTE: I have received a report that Mail::Folder::FastReader may fail for
very large mailboxes (>300MB). I have been unable to reproduce this bug so
far, and suspect that the very large mailbox has a particular email that is
problematic.


MODULE DEPENDENCIES

grepmail, by itself, can search mailboxes based on regular expression
patterns. However, if you want to search based on date, the
Date::Parse module is required. If you want to use more complex date
specifications, then Date::Manip should be installed as well.

Starting with version 4.44, an additional module is distributed with
grepmail, called Mail::Folder::FastReader. It implements the email
reading capability in C for 10-20% faster execution, depending on your
system. This module is compiled and installed during the installation
of grepmail (see below). You will need Inline version 0.41 or better.

The Date::Parse module is part of the TimeDate distribution, which can be
downloaded from:

  http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/GBARR/

Date::Manip is at:

  http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/SBECK/

Alternatively, installation can be done automatically using the CPAN module:

  perl -MCPAN -e 'install Date::Parse'
  perl -MCPAN -e 'install Date::Manip'


INSTALLATION

=> On Non-Windows systems:

  % perl Makefile.PL
  [Choose whether or not to use Mail::Folder::FastReader.]
  % make
  % make test
  % make install

If make test fails, please run

  make testfunc

and see which test(s) are failing. Please email the output of running
the particular test with the -D flag (e.g.:

  blib/script/grepmail library -D -d "before July 9 1998" t/mailarc-1.txt

to the address below.

If you see errors about your timezone, and you are in an uncommon timezone, it
may be the case that Date::Manip does not support your timezone yet. Try this:

  perl -MDate::Manip -e 'print "TIMEZONE: ".&Date::Manip::Date_TimeZone."\n"'

If you get an error, contact the author of Date::Manip.

=> On Windows systems:

- Just copy "grepmail" to a place in your path
