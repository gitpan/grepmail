grepmail version 3.2

Grepmail searches a normal or gzip'ed mailbox for a given regular expression,
and returns those emails that match it. Piped input is allowed, and date
restrictions are supported.

New in version 3.2: Added TMPFILE environment variable support, and a signal
handler. Fixed a bug where the last paragraph of the last email in a mailbox
would not be printed on Linux.

New in version 3.1: Modified the decompression to be more compatible with
older versions of gzip. Improved error checking so that "grepmail -h" prints a
usage message. Added -m flag, which causes an "X-Mailfolder" line to be added
to the header, thereby showing which folder contained the message.

Please send me any modifications you make. (for the better, that is. :) I have
a suite of tests that I can give you if you ask. Keep in mind that I'm likely
to turn down obscure features to avoid including everything but the kitchen
sink.
