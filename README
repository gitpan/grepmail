grepmail - search mailboxes for a particular email

Grepmail searches a normal, gzip'd, bzip'd, or tzip'd mailbox for a given
regular expression, and returns those emails that match it. Piped input is
allowed, and date and size restrictions are supported.

New in version 4.30:
- Updated code to avoid warnings under Perl 5.6
- Fixed a bug in the test script where bzip2, gzip, and tzip support would
  not be tested even though the programs were available.
- Added standard --help flag
- Added -u ("unique") flag, which ensures that no duplicate messages
  will be output.

New in version 4.23:
- Updated the test cases to work better in timezones close to +0000 and +2300.
  (email if you have problems with tests 1 and 23.)
- Fixed a bug in the "ignore attachments" code

See the file CHANGES for a complete change history and credits.


INSTALLATION

Two versions of grepmail are included in this distribution:
- grepmail.DP uses Date::Parse, quick parsing engine.
- grepmail.DM uses Date::Manip, a more flexible date parsing module that has
  better error checking than Date::Parse, but which causes grepmail to run
  about 60% slower. Date::Manip understands leap years and support date
  specifications like "2nd Thursday in July".

On Non-Windows systems:
  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make
  % make test
  % make install

If make test fails, please run "perl t/functionality.t" and see which test(s)
are failing. Please email the output of running the particular test with the
-D flag to the address below.

On Windows systems:
- Just pick which one you like, and rename it to "grepmail"
- Do "perldoc grepmail" for documentation
