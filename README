grepmail - search mailboxes for a particular email

Grepmail searches a normal, gzip'd, bzip'd, or tzip'd mailbox for a given
regular expression, and returns those emails that match it. Piped input is
allowed, and date and size restrictions are supported.

New in version 4.40:
- Date::Parse and Date::Manip version unified -- Date::Parse is now required,
  and Date::Manip (if present) is used to parse complex dates

New in version 4.31:
- Distro has missing test cases for -u functionality. Doh!

See the file CHANGES for a complete change history and credits.
