grepmail - search mailboxes for a particular email

Grepmail searches a normal, gzip'd, bzip'd, or tzip'd mailbox for a given
regular expression, and returns those emails that match it. Piped input is
allowed, and date and size restrictions are supported.

New in version 4.43:
- Fixed a bug in -r counting when used with -h.
- Fixed a bug in the handling of included messages.

New in version 4.42:
- Added -a flag to use received date instead of sent date for -d matches.
- Included emails are now ignored properly
- If an email has no date, the -d switch now issues a warning and does not
  treat the email as a match
- -d "" can be used to find emails without dates
- Mailbox files are now detected as files using 
  if ($buffer =~ /^(X-From-Line:|From) /im && $buffer =~ /^Subject: /im)
  rather than
  if ($buffer =~ /^(X-From-Line:|From) /im && $buffer =~ /^Date: /im)
- Improved detection of binary files
- STDERR and STDOUT now checked separately during "make test"
- Headers can now be in the format "Date:<tab>" in addition to "Date: "

MODULE DEPENDENCIES

grepmail requires the Date::Parse module. If the user wants to use more
complex date specifications with the -d flag, then Date::Manip should be
installed as well.

The Date::Parse module is part of the TimeDate distribution, which can be
downloaded from:

  http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/GBARR/

Date::Manip is at:

  http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/SBECK/

Alternatively, installation can be done automatically using the CPAN module:

  perl -MCPAN -e 'install Date::Parse'
  perl -MCPAN -e 'install Date::Manip'


INSTALLATION

On Non-Windows systems:
  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make
  % make test
  % make install

If make test fails, please run "perl t/functionality.t" and see which test(s)
are failing. Please email the output of running the particular test with the
-D flag (e.g.:
  blib/script/grepmail library -D -d "before July 9 1998" t/mailarc-1.txt
to the address below.

On Windows systems:
- Just copy "grepmail" to a place in your path
