grepmail version 2.1

Grepmail searches a normal or gzip'ed mailbox for a given regular expression,
and returns those emails that match it. Piped input is allowed, and date
restrictions are supported.

New in this version: Uses 1/3 less memory, and is slightly faster. Now
supports listing of files containing matching emails, count of emails that
match the pattern, and -e to specify the pattern. Use of "." for the search
pattern when using -d is no longer mandatory, although the pattern must now be
specified first.
