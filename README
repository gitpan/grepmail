grepmail - search mailboxes for a particular email

Grepmail searches a normal, gzip'd, bzip'd, or tzip'd mailbox for a given
regular expression, and returns those emails that match it. Piped input is
allowed, and date restrictions are supported.

New in version 4.20:
- grepmail development has been moved to SourceForge, and made public. Visit
  http://grepmail.sourceforge.net/
- Added -s flag, which limits matched emails to a given size
- Restructured the code to be more robust with respect to feature interaction.
  (At a 5-10% slowdown cost.)
- Fixed an uninitialized variable warning caused emails without subjects in
  debug mode.

New in version 4.11:
- Fixed a bug where an ASCII file would not be recognized as a mailbox when
  the first couple emails did not have a "From:" line. (Thanks to Jeff Flowers
  <jeff.flowers@npl.co.uk>)
- Added standard Perl testing.

See the file CHANGES for a complete change history.


INSTALLATION

Two versions of grepmail are included in this distribution:
- grepmail.DP uses Date::Parse, quick parsing engine.
- grepmail.DM uses Date::Manip, a more flexible date parsing module that has
  better error checking than Date::Parse, but which causes grepmail to run
  about 60% slower. Date::Manip understands leap years and support date
  specifications like "2nd Thursday in July".

On Non-Windows systems:
  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make
  % make test
  % make install

On Windows systems:
- Just pick which one you like, and rename it to "grepmail"
- Do "perldoc grepmail" for documentation
