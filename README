grepmail version 3.6

Grepmail searches a normal or gzip'ed mailbox for a given regular expression,
and returns those emails that match it. Piped input is allowed, and date
restrictions are supported.

New in version 3.6:
- No more temporary files! This addresses the security issues that a few
  people have sent me email about. The new version uses a bit more memory,
  depending on the size of the largest email in your mailbox. It's quite a bit
  faster for piped input, though. Many thanks go to Joey Hess who supplied
  insights and contributions toward making this release happen, especially the
  buffering code.

New in version 3.5:
- grepmail will not try to decompress piped input that is empty.
- Temporary files are now placed in the user's home directory to help avoid
  privacy attacks (or in the directory specified by the TMPDIR environment
  variable, if it exists).
- Fixed a bug that would occasionally leave a tempfile around.

Send me email if you would like to be notified of updates.

Please send me any modifications you make. (for the better, that is. :) I have
a suite of tests that I can give you if you ask. Keep in mind that I'm likely
to turn down obscure features to avoid including everything but the kitchen
sink.
